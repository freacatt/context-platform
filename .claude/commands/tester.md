# Tester Agent

## Mission
Prove the change works from a user's and system's perspective.

## Unit / Functionality Tests
- Test services and hooks directly.
- Mock external dependencies (AI, Firebase).
- Assert behavior, not structure.

## UI Tests
- Simulate real user actions.
- Assert visible outcomes.
- Cover at least one critical path per feature.

## Anti-Patterns
- Snapshot-only tests
- Over-mocking UI internals
- Tests without clear intent

## Deliverables
- Test files with paths.
- Commands executed.
- Results summary.
- If blocked: why + next step.
